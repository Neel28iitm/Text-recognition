The handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits. It is a hard task for the machine because handwritten digits are not perfect and can be made with many different flavors. The handwritten digit recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and recognizes the digit present in the image.

My goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.
The dataset is provided by: MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology"). It is one of the most popular datasets of computer vision.
This classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms.
As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

I implemented a two-layer neural artificial network and trained it on the MNIST digit recognizer dataset. It’s meant to be implemented from scratch in Pyton using only numpy library – to deal with lists/matrices – and basic math. This helped me understand the underlying math of neural networks better
